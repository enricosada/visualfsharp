#Visual F# Tools

###Contributing to the F# Language, Library, and Tools

You are invited to join with the F# Community and the Visual F# Tools team to help produce future releases of the F# language compiler, library, and tools.

F# is a mature, open source, cross-platform, functional-first programming language which empowers users and organizations to tackle complex computing problems with simple, maintainable, and robust code. F# is used in a wide range of application areas and is supported by Microsoft and other industry-leading companies providing professional tools, and by an active open community. You can find out more about F# at http://fsharp.org.

Changes contributed here are packaged into the Visual F# Tools, the F# Open Edition, and other open source F# editing tools. Microsoft coordinates packaging this repository as part of the Visual F# Tools, while the F# community coordinates packaging it as the Open Edition of F# for use on Linux, OSX, Android, iOS, and other platforms, via the [fsharp/fsharp GitHub repo](https://github.com/fsharp/fsharp/).
